#+title: Epidemic model predictor
#+options: tex:t
* Introduction:
This project serves as a _tool_ for medical professionals, who can use it to determine the rate of growth of a disease, *say an epidemic*.

A _disease model_ is a /mathematical representation/ of the spread of an infectious disease. It can be used to understand how a disease spreads, predict the number of people who will be infected, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions like vaccination.

It /optionally/ accepts parameters such as population (/young/ and /old/ percentages), birth rate and death rate as _population variables_. It receives _disease_ input such as /rate of infection/, /recovery rate/ and /incubation period/ for the vaccine.



* Terms used in the program
*** Population variables:
**** Total population ~Pop~
**** Younger and older population ~Pop1~, ~Pop2~
**** Adult population ~Pop2~ := ~Pop~ - ~Pop1~
**** Birth rate ~birthRate~
**** Death rate ~deathRate~
**** Population growth ~PopGrowth~
*** Disease variables:
**** Number of infected people on day 1 ~Inf~
**** Transmission rate ~transRate~
**** Recovery rate ~recRate~
**** Contact rate ~contRate~
**** Incubation period ~incubPrd~
**** Number of days after being infected when people isolate themselves ~n~
*** Vaccination variables:
**** Number of days after the first attack when the vaccine takes effect ~d~
**** Efficiency of the vaccine ~η~
**** Rate of vaccination (Rv) ~ρ~

Days for the disease to take over: $Inf_d$ := $Pop$ + \frac{Pop\times Pop_{growth}\times d}{365} - \frac{death_{rate}\times Pop\times d}{365}

We're assuming that the disease leaves as quickly as it comes!!!
